        				<td>John Smith</td>
        				<td>Reichsführer John Smith (October 14, 1914 - ca. 1965) was a former U.S Army Captain who joined the SS following the surrender of the United States. He quickly rose through the ranks to Obergruppenführer, and was assigned to investigate the American Resistance in New York.
						Smith was instrumental in dismantling a conspiracy masterminded by Martin Heusmann and Reinhard Heydrich that sought to overthrow Adolf Hitler and annihilate the Japanese Empire in order to usher in a new age. He consequently became the first American to be promoted to the rank of Oberst-Gruppenführer. He was later appointed Reichsmarschall of Nazi America by Reichsführer Heinrich Himmler when the previous Reichsmarschall, George Lincoln Rockwell, was exiled. He took control of Nazi America as its Reichsführer after he initiated a putsch against Himmler.He served as the main antagonist of both Season Four and the entire series as a whole.</td>
